# API Overview

FDC3 API standards support the following goals:
- Create a consistent developer interface for working with FDC3 
- Standardize interfaces for reference implementations
- Standardize interfaces between Desktop Agents

The role of FDC3 API standards is to establish a baseline interface for interoperability between applications. Because FDC3 is largely an agreement between existing platforms and applications - standards should be optimized for ease of adoption rather than functional completeness. Functionality absent from a FDC3 specification is in no way a commentary its importance.

The focus on the API working group has been to create a small but consistent API, the following docs go through the components and API's in detail.
