        The technology type that is used to launch and run the application. 
        Each application type implies a particular set of launch `details`.
        The supported types include:

        - `web`: Web applications launched via a URL
        - `native`: Native applications pre-installed on a device and launch via a filesystem path
        - `citrix`: Apps virtualized via Citrix
        - `onlineNative`: Native apps that have an online launcher, e.g. online ClickOnce app deployments.
        - `other`: Used to represent apps that do not conform to or cannot be launched via the other types, and are likely to be defined solely by a hostManifest.

        FDC3 Desktop Agents MUST support at least the `web` application type and MAY support any or all of the other types.

        - web

        Metadata that describes how the application uses FDC3 APIs. This metadata serves multiple purposes:
        
        - It supports intent resolution by a desktop agent, by declaring what intents an app listens for.
        - It may be used, for example in an app catalog UI, to find apps that 'interoperate with' other apps. 
        - It provides a standard location to document how the app interacts with user channels, app channels, 
          and intents, for use by other app developers and desktop assemblers.
