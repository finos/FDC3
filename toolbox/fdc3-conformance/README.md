# FDC3 Conformance Testing

This folder contains test packs (test definitions) for conformance with FDC3.

You can find the implementation of these tests in the [FDC3 Conformance Framework](https://github.com/finos/FDC3-conformance-framework) project.

There are currently 5 sections to this.  Where tests apply to a particular version of FDC3, this is labelled with icons in the header, like so: 
- ![1.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/FDC3-1.2-green) _Applies to FDC3 1.2 specifically_
- ![2.0+](https://img.shields.io/badge/FDC3-2.0+-blue) _Applies to all FDC3 2.0 and later versions_
- ![2.2+](https://img.shields.io/badge/FDC3-2.2+-purple) _Applies to FDC3 2.2 and later versions_
