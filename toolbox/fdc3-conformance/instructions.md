# How to Apply For FDC3 Certification for a Desktop Agent

## 1. Run The Conformance Tests Yourself.

See [Readme](README.md) about how to do this.  
 
## 2. Raise An Issue On This project

[Raise An Issue](https://github.com/finos/FDC3-Conformance-Framework/issues) on the FDC3 Conformance Project.  

In all likelihood, you will need to liase with the maintainers of this project in order to get the conformance tests to work with your desktop agent.  

This will also kick off the process of applying for the "FDC3 Certified" mark.

- Provide details in the issue about how you configured and ran the conformance tests in step 1 above.
- Provide the test results (number of passes / fails, details of failed tests, versions used) in the issue.

## 3.  Replication

Maintainers of the FDC3 Conformance Framework will aim to replicate your test results.  You must work with them to provide the correct version(s) of your software and resolve any issues around licensing that may arise in order  that they can proceed.  

## 4.  Fees

Fees for certification are:

|FINOS Membership Level        |Fee per Unit*     |
|------------------------------|------------------|
|Platinum|Free (unlimited units) |
|Gold    |Free (up to 3 units each membership year) |
|Silver |Free (first unit each membership year)|
|Additional Units / Non Members |$20,000 per unit|

These fees are to cover work done by the FINOS for the formal certification process and badge issuance. 

*A _unit_ here refers to a particular vendor software version and FDC3 version _combination_, as described in the [Terms and Conditions](terms-conditions/FDC3-Certified-Terms.md)

## 5.  Failed Tests

If your desktop agent fails any of the conformance tests, the maintainers will inform you via the issue you opened in order that you can make fixes to your software and retry the process.

## 6.  Terms

Once your desktop agent has passed the complete suite of tests, you will be required to accept the [Terms and Conditions](terms-conditions/FDC3-Certified-Terms.md) via the completion of the [Participation Form](terms-conditions/participation-form.md).

## 7.  Badge

On completion of the above steps you will be given your certificate via the [Credly](https://cred.ly) platform for use in your own materials / publicity.

## 8.  Re-Certification

Certification only applies to a single version of your software product. FINOS reserves the right to allow certification to carry over at no additional cost for minor/maintenance version changes of your desktop agent if no backward incompatible changes are introduced in those versions.
