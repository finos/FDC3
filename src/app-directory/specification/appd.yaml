    Application:
      description: >
        Defines an application retrieved from an FDC3 App Directory, which can
        then be launched.

        Launching typically means running for a user on a desktop. 
        The details around 'launching' including who or what might do it, and how the launch action is initiated are
        discussed elsewhere in the FDC3 App Directory spec.
      required:
        - appId
        - name
        - manifest

        name:
          type: string
          description: >
            The name of the application.

            The name should be unique within an FDC3 App Directory instance. The
            exception to the uniqueness constraint is that an App Directory can
            hold definitions for multiple versions of the same app.

            The same appName could occur in other directories. We are not
            currently specifying app name conventions in the document.
        manifest:

          description: >
            URI or full JSON of the application manifest providing all details related to launch
            and use requirements as described by the vendor.

            The format of this manifest is vendor specific, but can be identified by
            the manifestType attribute.
        manifestType:
          type: string
          description: >
            The manifest type which relates to the format and structure of the manifest content.
            The definition is based on the vendor specific format and definition outside of this specification.
