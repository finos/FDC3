/**
 * Function used to retrieve an FDC3 Desktop Agent API instance, which
 * supports the discovery of a Desktop Agent Preload (a container-injected
 * API implementation) or a Desktop Agent Proxy (a Browser-based Desktop Agent
 * running in another window or frame). Finally, if no Desktop Agent is found,
 * a failover function may be supplied by an app allowing it to start or otherwise
 * connect to a Desktop Agent (e.g. by loading a proprietary adaptor that
 * returns a `DesktopAgent` implementation or by creating a window or iframe of
 * its own that will provide a Desktop Agent Proxy.
 *
 * @param {GetAgentParams} params Optional parameters object, which
 * may include a URL to use for the app's identity, other settings
 * that affect the behavior of the getAgent() function and a `failover`
 * function that should be run if a Desktop Agent is not detected.
 *
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a DesktopAgent implementation or
 * rejects with an error message from the `AgentError` enumeration if unable to
 * return a Desktop Agent implementation.
 *
 * @example
 * const fdc3 = await getAgent();
 *
 * // OR
 *
 * getAgent({
 *     identityUrl: "https://example.com/path?param=appName#example",
 *     channelSelector: false,
 *     intentResolver: false
 * }).then((fdc3) => {
 *     //do FDC3 stuff here
 * };
 */

/**
 * @typedef {Object} GetAgentParams Type representing parameters passed to the
 * getAgent function.
 *
 * @property {number} timeoutMs Number of milliseconds to allow for an FDC3
 * implementation to be found before calling the failover function or
 * rejecting (default 750). Note that the timeout is cancelled as soon as a
 * Desktop Agent is detected. There may be additional set-up steps to perform
 * which will happen outside the timeout.
 *
 * @property {string} identityUrl The app's current URL is normally sent to
 * a web-based desktop agent to help establish its identity. This property
 * may be used to override the URL sent (to handle situations where an app's
 * URL is not sufficiently stable to use for identity purposes,  e.g. due to
 * client-side route changes when navigating within the app). The URL set MUST
 * match the origin of the application (scheme, hostname, and port) or it will
 * be ignored. If not specified, the app's current URL will be used.
 *
 * @property {boolean} channelSelector Flag indicating that the application
 * needs access to a channel selector UI (i.e. because it supports User Channels
 * and does not implement its own UI for selecting channels). Defaults to
 * `true`. MAY be ignored by Desktop Agent Preload (container) implementations.
 *
 * @property {boolean} intentResolver Flag indicating that the application
 * needs access to an intent resolver UI (i.e. because it supports raising one
 * or more intents and and does not implement its own UI for selecting target
 * apps). Defaults to `true`. MAY be ignored by Desktop Agent Preload (container)
 * implementations.
 *
 * @property {boolean} dontSetWindowFdc3 For backwards compatibility, `getAgent`
 * will set a reference to the Desktop Agent implementation at `window.fdc3`
 * if one does not already exist, and will fire the fdc3Ready event. Defaults to
 * `false`. Setting this flag to `true` will inhibit that behavior, leaving
 * `window.fdc3` unset.
 *
 * @property {function} failover An optional function that provides a
 * means of connecting to or starting a Desktop Agent, which will be called
 * if no Desktop Agent is detected. Must return either a Desktop Agent
 * implementation directly (e.g. by using a proprietary adaptor) or a
 * WindowProxy (e.g a reference to another window returned by `window.open`
 * or an iframe's `contentWindow`) for a window or frame in which it has loaded
 * a Desktop Agent or suitable proxy to one that works with FDC3 Web Connection
 * and Desktop Agent Communication Protocols.
