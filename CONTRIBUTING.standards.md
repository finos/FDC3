1\.    Establishment.

1.1.    Purposes. The purposes of this Project are: To develop specific protocols and taxonomies to advance the ability of desktop applications in financial workflows to interoperate in a plug-and-play fashion, without prior bi-lateral agreements.

1.2.    Initial Steering Members. The initial Steering Members of this Project are: OpenFin, J.P. Morgan.

1.3.   Project Initiation.  The Project will become effective upon ratification of this Charter by FINOS and the Joining of 2 Steering Members.  New parties may Join the Project upon Approval of the Steering Members.

1.4.   Applicable Policies. This Project and all Participants are subject to the FINOS Charter, Intellectual Property Policy ("IP Policy"), Antitrust Policy, Code of Conduct, and any other FINOS or Linux Foundation policy that by its terms applies to all FINOS projects.

2\.    Membership Levels. The Project will include the following levels of membership, each referred to as a "Participant":

2.1.   Steering Member.  Steering Members may participate in each Working Group and appoint one participant to the Steering Committee. The initial Steering Members are set forth in the Project Charter.

2.2.   Contributor.  All Participants in the Project that are not Steering Members are Contributors. Contributors may participate in each Working Group, but do not participate on the Steering Committee.

3\.    Intellectual Property. This Project and its activities are governed by the IP Policy, and all Submissions by Participants shall be licensed under the terms set forth in that policy.

4\.    Organization.

4.1.   Steering Committee.  The Steering Committee is the body that is responsible for governing the Project.

4.2.   Chair(s). The Project will have one or more Chairs, whose responsibilities are to lead the Steering Committee, organize meetings, organize votes, form new Working Groups, track Working Group progress and ensure they meet their goals, and any other activities Approved by the Steering Members.  The Steering Committee may select a new Chair upon Approval of the Steering Members.

5\.    Decision Making.

5.1.   Approval.  The Steering Committee and each Working Group will endeavor to make all decisions by consensus.  Where the Steering Committee or Working Group cannot reach consensus with respect to a particular decision, the Steering Committee or Working Group will make that decision by a Supermajority Vote of the Steering Members or Working Group Participants, as applicable.

5.2.   Notifications and Electronic Voting.  The Chair(s) are responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Steering Members and each Working Group chair is responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Working Group for which it is the chair, in each case subject to the following minimum criteria: (i) in-person meetings require at least 30 days' prior written notice, (ii) teleconference meetings require at least 7 days' prior written notice (this requirement only applies to the notification of the first meeting of automatically recurring teleconference meetings), and (iii) electronic votes require no advance notice but must be made pursuant to a clear and unambiguous ballot with only "yes" and "no" options, and the voting must remain open for no fewer than 7 days.  These notification requirements with respect to the Project or that particular Working Group may be overridden upon unanimous consent of all Steering Members or all applicable Working Group Participants that have attended and participated in at least 50% of the last 4 meetings of the Project or Particular Working Group.

6\.    Deliverable Development Process.

6.1.   Working Groups.  The Project may have multiple Working Groups, and each Working Group will operate as set forth in this
Section.

6.2.   Working Group Chair.  Each Working Group will designate a chair for that Working Group.  A Working Group may select a new chair upon Approval of the Working Group Participants.

6.3.   Working Group Requirements.  Each Working Group must be comprised of at least 2 Working Group Participants.  No
Working Group Participant will be permitted to participate in a Working Group without first Joining the Working Group.

7\.    Deliverable Development Process.

7.1.   Pre-Draft.  Any Working Group Participant or Contributor may submit a proposed initial draft document as a candidate Draft Deliverable of that Working Group.  The Working Group chair will designate each submission as a "Pre-Draft" document.

7.2.   Draft.  Each Pre-Draft document of a Working Group must first be Approved by the Working Group Participants of that Working Group to become a Draft Deliverable.  Once the Working Group approves a document as a Draft Deliverable, the Draft Deliverable becomes the basis for all going forward work on that deliverable.

7.3.   Working Group Approval.  Once a Working Group believes it has achieved the objectives for its deliverable as described in the Scope, it will progress its Draft Deliverable to "Working Group Approved" status.

7.4.   Final Approval.  Upon a Draft Deliverable reaching Working Group Approved status, the Chair(s) or their designee will present that Working Group Approved Draft Deliverable to all Steering Members for Approval. Working Group Participants will be reminded of Section V.3.1(c) of the IP Policy, which says that if a participant wishes to require implementers of the standard to obtain an explicit license from them, they must disclose the relevant patents, necessary claims, and the relevant portion of the standard to legal@finos.org using the appropriate form. Upon Approval by the Steering Members, that Draft Deliverable will be designated an "Approved Deliverable."

7.5.   Publication and Submission.  Upon the designation of a Draft Deliverable as an Approved Deliverable, the Chair(s) will publish the Approved Deliverable in a manner agreed upon by the Working Group Participants (i.e., Project Participant only location, publicly available location, Project maintained website, Project member website, etc.).  The publication of an Approved Deliverable in a publicly accessible manner must include the terms under which the Approved Deliverable and/or source code is being made available under, as set forth in the applicable Working Group Charter. It must also include the statement required by Section V.3.2.1 of the IP Policy:

    Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the standard set forth in this document, and to provide supporting documentation.

7.6.   Submissions to Standards Bodies.  No Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable may be submitted to another standards development organization without Approval by the Steering Members.  Upon Approval by the Steering Members, the Chair(s) will coordinate the submission of the applicable Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable to another standards development organization with FINOS. Working Group Participants that developed that Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable agree to grant the copyright rights necessary to make those submissions.

8\.    Withdrawal and Termination.

8.1.   Term.  This Project Charter shall remain in effect until the Steering Committee votes to terminate the Project as described in Section 8.3 below, or, if at any time the Project is inactive for more than 1 year, FINOS may terminate the Project with notice to all Participants.

8.2.   Withdrawal or Termination. A Participant may withdraw from a Working Group or the Project at any time by notifying the Chair(s) in writing, and that withdrawal is effective upon receipt of the notice. Upon a Supermajority Vote of all Steering Members (calculated without the vote of the Steering Member in question), a Participant may be terminated from the Project or withdrawn from a Working Group.

8.3.   Project Termination.  Upon a Supermajority Vote of the Steering Members, the Project will cease and terminate as of the effective date designated in that vote.  The Chair(s) will coordinate with FINOS to facilitate that termination.

8.4.   Effect of Withdrawal or Termination. Upon a Participant's written withdrawal from a Working Group or upon the termination of its Project membership, all existing commitments and obligations with respect to the Project or Working Group, as the case may be, up to the effective date of withdrawal or termination will remain in effect, but no new obligations will be incurred.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the patent licensing commitments shall continue to apply to any patent claims that would be subject to a patent licensing commitment for a Final Specification unless withdrawal or termination occurs fewer than 60 days after the Participant Joins the Project.

9\.    Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers.  Participants represent and warrant that they are legally entitled to grant the rights and promises set forth in this Charter.
