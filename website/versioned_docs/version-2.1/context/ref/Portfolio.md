# `Portfolio`

A financial portfolio made up of multiple positions (holdings) in several instruments. Contrast this
with e.g. the [InstrumentList](InstrumentList) type, which is just a list of instruments.

This is a good example of how types can be composed and extended with extra properties to define more complex types.

The [Portfolio](Portfolio) type consists of an array of [Position](Position) types, each of which
refers to a single [Instrument](Instrument) and a holding amount for that instrument.

Notes:

- Like all other FDC3 context types, extra properties for the portfolio can be added, the schema just
specifies the minimum contract.

- The portfolio schema does not explicitly include identifiers in the `id` section, as there
is not a common standard for such identifiers. Applications can, however, populate
this part of the contract with custom identifiers if so desired.
