# `Product`

[`@experimental`](/docs/fdc3-compliance#experimental-features) context type representing a tradable product. To be used with OMS and EMS systems. This type is currently only loosely defined as an extensible context object, with an optional instrument field.

Notes:

- The Product schema does not explicitly include identifiers in the `id` section, as there is not a common standard for such identifiers. Applications can, however, populate this part of the contract with custom identifiers if so desired.

## Type

`fdc3.product`
