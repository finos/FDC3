# `Order`

[`@experimental`](/docs/fdc3-compliance#experimental-features) context type representing an order. To be used with OMS and EMS systems.

This type currently only defines a required `id` field, which should provide a reference to the order in one or more systems, an optional human-readable `name` field to be used to summarize the order, and an optional `details` field that may be used to provide additional detail about the order, including a Context representing a `product`, which may be extended with arbitrary properties. The `details.product` field is currently typed as an unspecified Context type, but both `details` and `details.product` are expected to be standardized in the future.
