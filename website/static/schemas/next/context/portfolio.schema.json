  "description": "A financial portfolio made up of multiple positions (holdings) in several instruments. Contrast this with e.g. the [InstrumentList](InstrumentList) type, which is just a list of instruments.\n\nThis is a good example of how types can be composed and extended with extra properties to define more complex types.\n\nThe Portfolio type consists of an array of [Position](Position) types, each of which refers to a single [Instrument](Instrument) and a holding amount for that instrument.\n\nThe portfolio schema does not explicitly include identifiers in the `id` section, as there bis not a common standard for such identifiers. Applications can, however, populate this part of the contract with custom identifiers if so desired.",
