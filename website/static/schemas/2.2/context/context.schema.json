  "description": "The `fdc3.context` type defines the basic contract or \"shape\" for all data exchanged by FDC3 operations. As such, it is not really meant to be used on its own, but is imported by more specific type definitions (standardized or custom) to provide the structure and properties shared by all FDC3 context data types.\n\nThe key element of FDC3 context types is their mandatory `type` property, which is used to identify what type of data the object represents, and what shape it has.\n\nThe FDC3 context type, and all derived types, define the minimum set of fields a context data object of a particular type can be expected to have, but this can always be extended with custom fields as appropriate.",

For non-standard types, e.g. those defined and used by a particular organization, the convention is to prefix them with an organization-specific namespace, e.g. `blackrock.fund`.\n\nSee the [Context Data Specification](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/context/spec) for more information about context data types."

The idea behind this design is that applications can provide as many equivalent identifiers to a target application as possible, e.g. an instrument may be represented by an ISIN, CUSIP or Bloomberg identifier.\n\nIdentifiers do not make sense for all types of data, so the `id` property is therefore optional, but some derived types may choose to require at least one identifier.
