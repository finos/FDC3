Security and Identity features are experimental additions to FDC3. Limited aspects of their design may change in future.

:::

As FDC3 evolves from desktop containers to web-based implementations, new security challenges arise in open, decentralized environments. This specification defines mechanisms for **application identity verification**, **encrypted communications**, and **user identity sharing** across FDC3-enabled applications.

The security model is built on **asymmetric cryptography**: each participating application holds a private key (kept secret) and publishes a corresponding public key at a stable HTTPS endpoint. Other applications use that public key to verify the application's digital signatures and to encrypt data that only it can read. All cryptographic operations that involve a private key MUST be performed in a trusted backend (server), not in the browser frontend.

## Overview

FDC3 Security addresses the following key challenges:

1. **Shift to Web**: Web environments are more hostile than controlled desktop containers, requiring robust identity verification
2. **App Identity**: Applications need verifiable identities to establish trust
3. **User Authentication**: Users need portable identity across heterogeneous applications  
4. **Data Integrity**: Context data requires authenticity guarantees
5. **Scalable Trust**: Moving beyond bilateral trust relationships to independently maintained allowlists

The security framework introduces:

- **Digital Signatures** for proving data authenticity and app identity
- **Encrypted Channels** for private communications
- **JWT-based User Identity** for portable authentication


### Context Types

The following context types support security features:

| Context Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [`fdc3.security.user`](../context/ref/security/User) | User identity with JWT |
| [`fdc3.security.userRequest`](../context/ref/security/UserRequest) | Request for user identity |
| [`fdc3.security.symmetricKeyRequest`](../context/ref/security/SymmetricKeyRequest) | Request for encryption key |
| [`fdc3.security.symmetricKeyResponse`](../context/ref/security/SymmetricKeyResponse) | Encryption key response |
| [`fdc3.security.encryptedContext`](../context/ref/security/EncryptedContextWrapper) | Encrypted context wrapper |

### Intents

| Intent | Input Context | Output Context | Description |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| `GetUser` | `fdc3.security.userRequest` | `fdc3.security.user` | Request user identity from an identity provider app |

## Desktop Agent Requirements

Desktop Agents MUST forward context objects and their associated metadata to receiving applications without modification. Desktop Agents MUST NOT inspect, strip, or alter `signature`, `antiReplay`, or any other security-related metadata fields. The security model defined in this document relies on this guarantee: cryptographic verification is performed end-to-end between applications, not by the Desktop Agent.

## Trusted Backend Contract

Web applications are split into a *front end* (browser context) and a *back end* (server). Because servers can hold private keys securely, all cryptographic operations — signing, key generation, decryption — MUST be performed in the trusted backend. The frontend holds only public keys and delegates sensitive operations to the backend over a secure channel (e.g. a WebSocket).

The contract between the frontend and backend is application-defined, but must cover at minimum:

- Signing outbound context objects
- Generating or holding symmetric encryption keys
- Unwrapping JWE-wrapped keys received from other applications

:::tip Reference implementation

`@finos/fdc3-security` provides `FDC3Handlers` (a TypeScript interface) and matching `ClientSideHandlersImpl` / `ServerSideHandlersImpl` helpers that implement this pattern over a WebSocket. See the [README](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/main/packages/fdc3-security/README.md) for details.

Runnable example apps that demonstrate the trusted backend pattern:

| App | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| [`signed-sender`](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/tree/main/toolbox/fdc3-example-apps/server-apps/signed-sender) | Backend signs `fdc3.instrument` via `BasicSignedBroadcaster`; frontend calls `handleRemoteChannel` to share the channel with the server |
| [`signed-receiver`](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/tree/main/toolbox/fdc3-example-apps/server-apps/signed-receiver) | Frontend delegates key requests over WebSocket; signature verification runs in the browser against JWKS fetched from the sender |
| [`encrypted-channel-sender`](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/tree/main/toolbox/fdc3-example-apps/server-apps/encrypted-channel-sender) | Symmetric key is created in the browser; backend exposes only a JWKS endpoint and a secure-boundary unwrap helper |
| [`encrypted-channel-receiver`](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/tree/main/toolbox/fdc3-example-apps/server-apps/encrypted-channel-receiver) | Backend unwraps the symmetric key and signs key requests; frontend holds the unwrapped key for low-latency decryption (frontend-key pattern) |

:::

### `FDC3Handlers`

[`FDC3Handlers`](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/main/packages/fdc3-security/src/secure-boundary/FDC3Handlers.ts) is the contract the trusted backend implements in the `@finos/fdc3-security` reference implementation. This enables the front-end part of your application to get contexts signed, generate encryption keys or deal with any secure operations that might involve the application's private key or sensitive data.

:::tip

It is not a requirement for applications to use this code, but it is provided to simplify the efforts required to export the parts of FDC3 functionality your app needs to run in a "high-trust" environment onto the server side.

#### Example 1: Bridging a channel with `handleRemoteChannel`

The front end keeps the live `Channel` from the Desktop Agent; `handleRemoteChannel` mirrors it to the back end so signing can run where private keys live. Broadcasts initiated on the server flow through the proxy to the real channel.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant BEA as App Back End
    participant FEA as App Front End
    participant DA as Desktop Agent

    DA-->>FEA: Channel
    FEA->>BEA: handleRemoteChannel(purpose, channel) over WebSocket

    Note over BEA: back end decides to broadcast
    BEA->>BEA: sign context on the back end
    BEA-->>FEA: Signed context passed to front end
    FEA->>DA: channel broadcast (with signed context)
    Note over DA: context delivered to other apps / listeners
```

#### Example 2: Resolving intents with `remoteIntentHandler`

App A registers an intent listener in the browser using a handler obtained from its back end. When App B raises the intent, the Desktop Agent delivers it to App A's front end, which forwards handling to **App Back End A** and returns the result.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant BEA as App Back End A
    participant FEA as App Front End A
    participant DA as Desktop Agent
    participant FEB as App Front End B
    Note over FEA: App A wants to handle MyIntent
    FEA->>BEA: calls remoteIntentHandler 'MyIntent'
    BEA-->>FEA: returns remoteIntentHandler
    FEA->>DA: addIntentListener('MyIntent', remoteIntentHandler)
    FEB->>DA: raiseIntent('MyIntent', context)
    DA->>FEA: deliver intent to listener
    FEA->>BEA: forward to backend handler
    BEA-->>FEA: signed or encrypted result
    FEA->>DA: return result
    DA-->>FEB: resolution

### Public / Private Keys

To participate in the FDC3 security model, an application needs a public/private key pair. The private key is used to sign outbound context objects and to decrypt data encrypted for this application by others. The public key is shared so that other applications can verify signatures and encrypt data that only this application can read.

To enable verification, applications publish their public keys at a stable HTTPS endpoint. The conventional location is `/.well-known/jwks.json` on the application's origin—a path established by [RFC 8615](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615) for well-known URIs. The URL serves both as the key delivery mechanism and as an identifier for the publisher: the `jku` in a JWS header points to this endpoint so receivers know where to fetch the verification key.

:::note
Keys in the JWKS MUST include a `kid` (key ID) so signers can reference them in JWS headers and receivers can select the correct key for verification.
:::

To participate in the FDC3 security model, an application should:

1. Generate a public/private key pair.
2. Publish the public key at an HTTPS endpoint as a [JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517). The URL at which the JWKS is served identifies the entity of the publisher.

### Key Management

Applications participating in the FDC3 security model are responsible for the following key management practices:

- Private keys MUST be stored securely and never transmitted
- JWKS endpoints MUST be served over HTTPS with valid certificates
- Key rotation SHOULD be performed periodically
- Old keys SHOULD remain available for verification during transition periods
- Applications SHOULD log authentication and authorization decisions for audit
- Handle unsigned contexts gracefully with appropriate user prompts

## Trust Model

In this context, *trust* means that a receiving application has decided that a particular sender's identity claims and signed data are credible and should be acted upon. Trust is determined and enforced by applications, not by the Desktop Agent. Each application independently maintains an allowlist of senders it trusts. Desktop Agents are untrusted intermediaries: they route context and metadata but MUST NOT be relied upon for cryptographic operations or trust decisions. Application front-ends (browser contexts) are untrusted: private keys MUST NOT be sent to or stored in front-end code; signing and other sensitive operations MUST be performed in a trusted back-end.

### Trust Function

Receiving applications define an allowlist of trusted senders — other applications whose signed data they are willing to accept. Each application independently decides which senders it trusts; there is no shared membership mechanism. Given the signer's JWKS URL (`jku`) from the JWS header — and optionally the issuer (`iss`) for JWT verification — the allowlist function returns `true` if the signer is trusted. When verifying a signature, the receiving application's security implementation sets `authenticity.trusted` to the result of this function.

:::tip Example implementation

The `@finos/fdc3-security` library supports an `allowListFunction(jku, iss?)` callback when configuring signature verification. The following are example implementations:

```typescript
/**
 * Determines whether a signing application is trusted by this application.
 * @param jku - The JWKS URL from the signer's JWS protected header, identifying the signer.
 * @param iss - The issuer claim from a JWT payload; only present when verifying user identity tokens.
 * @returns true if the signer should be trusted; false otherwise.
 */
const allowListFunction = (jku: string, iss?: string): boolean => {
  return TRUSTED_JWKS_URLS.has(jku);
};

// Example: allow list for three trusted apps
const TRUSTED_JWKS_URLS = new Set([
  'https://app-a.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json',
  'https://app-b.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json',
  'https://data-provider.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json',
]);
```

```typescript
/**
 * Determines whether a signing application is trusted, with per-issuer restrictions.
 * @param jku - The JWKS URL from the signer's JWS protected header, identifying the signer.
 * @param iss - The issuer claim from a JWT payload; only present when verifying user identity tokens.
 * @returns true if the signer should be trusted; false otherwise.
 */
const allowListFunction = (jku: string, iss?: string): boolean => {
  // Example: using iss for JWT verification (e.g. user identity)
  // Restrict which issuers are trusted per JWKS URL—useful when an identity provider app hosts multiple issuers
  if (!TRUSTED_ISSUERS_BY_JKU[jku]) return false;
  // For detached JWS (context signing), iss is undefined—trust jku alone
  if (!iss) return true;
  return TRUSTED_ISSUERS_BY_JKU[jku].has(iss);
};

const TRUSTED_ISSUERS_BY_JKU: Record<string, Set<string>> = {
  'https://idp.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json': new Set(['https://idp.example.com', 'tenant-a.idp.example.com']),
  'https://enterprise-sso.corp.com/.well-known/jwks.json': new Set(['https://enterprise-sso.corp.com']),
};

## App Identity and Signatures

### Signing Context Data

Applications can sign the context objects they broadcast using their private key. This allows receiving applications to verify:

1. **Origin**: Which application sent the data
2. **Integrity**: Whether the data was tampered with in transit

### Signature Metadata

When signing a context, the sender includes the `signature` and `antiReplay` fields in the `metadata` parameter passed to `broadcast()` or `raiseIntent()` (typed as [`AppProvidableContextMetadata`](ref/Metadata#appprovidablecontextmetadata)). The signature is therefore carried separately from the context object itself. When a receiving application's [`ContextHandler`](ref/Types#contexthandler) or [`IntentHandler`](ref/Types#intenthandler) is invoked, those fields are present in the [`ContextMetadata`](ref/Metadata#contextmetadata) argument alongside the Desktop Agent-provided `source` field.

| Context Metadata field | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `signature` | The detached JWS (`protected` + `signature`) |
| `antiReplay` | Claims (`iat`, `exp`, `jti`) used for replay detection; must be included when signing |

### Signature Structure

The `signature` is a detached [JSON Web Signature (JWS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515). The `protected` header, when base64url-decoded, contains:

| Header field | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `alg` | Signature algorithm (e.g., `EdDSA`) |
| `jku` | URL of the JWKS containing the public key for verification |
| `kid` | Key identifier within the JWKS |
| `iat` | Issued-at time (Unix timestamp), prevents replay |
| `exp` | Expiration time (Unix timestamp) |
| `jti` | Unique token ID for replay protection |

### Generating The Signature

To generate a signature, the signer:

1. Creates `antiReplay` claims: `iat` (current time), `exp` (iat + validity window), and `jti` (random UUID).
2. Canonicalizes `{ context, antiReplay }` and signs it with the private key using [JOSE](https://github.com/panva/jose) (or any [JWS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515)-compliant library). Use `CompactSign` to produce a compact JWS; the protected header includes `alg`, `jku`, `kid`, and `iat`.
3. Extracts the detached form: the compact JWS (`header.payload.signature`) yields `protected` (header) and `signature`—the payload is omitted since the signed data is the context itself. Returns `{ protected, signature }` plus `antiReplay` in metadata.

### Flow Diagram

```mermaid

    participant SFE as Sender (front end)
    participant DA as Desktop Agent
    participant R as Receiver

    Note over SBE: Build antiReplay (iat, exp, jti)
    Note over SBE: Canonicalize { context, antiReplay }
    Note over SBE: Sign with private key → detached JWS in metadata
    Note over SBE: Serve JWKS at jku (HTTPS)

    SBE->>SFE: Relay signed message (context + signature + antiReplay)
    SFE->>DA: broadcast / raiseIntent (context + metadata)
    Note over DA: Untrusted relay — forward unchanged
    DA->>R: context + metadata

    Note over R: Decode protected header (alg, jku, kid, …)
    R->>SBE: HTTPS: fetch JWKS (jku)
    SBE-->>R: JWKS / verification key

    Note over R: Reconstitute compact JWS, verify signature
    Note over R: Validate iat, antiReplay.exp, jti
    Note over R: allowListFunction(jku) → authenticity.trusted

    Note over R: Pass context + metadata to security implementation
    Note over R: Receive ContextVerificationMetadata for trust decision
```

### Example

```typescript
// When broadcasting or raising an intent, include signature and antiReplay in metadata
channel.broadcast(
  { type: "fdc3.instrument", id: { ticker: "AAPL" } },
  {
    signature: {
      protected: "<base64url-encoded JWS protected header>",  // contains alg, jku, kid, iat, exp, jti
      signature: "<base64url-encoded digital signature>"
    },
    antiReplay: { iat: 1739692800, exp: 1739696100, jti: "unique-token-id" }
  }
);
```

### Checking the Signature

To verify a signature, the receiver:

1. Extracts `alg`, `jku`, `kid`, and `iat` from the JWS protected header.
2. Resolves the public key from the `jku` JWKS URL (via a resolver or [JOSE](https://github.com/panva/jose) remote JWKS).
3. Reconstitutes the full JWS: canonicalizes `{ context, antiReplay }`, base64url-encodes it as the payload, and forms `header.payload.signature`. Uses `compactVerify` (or equivalent) to verify the signature.
4. Validates freshness (`iat`), context expiry (`antiReplay.exp`), and anti-replay claims (`jti`).
5. Returns an authenticity result object for the application to use in trust decisions.

### Authenticity Metadata

After receiving a signed context, the application passes the received [`ContextMetadata`](ref/Metadata#contextmetadata) to its security implementation's verification function. That function returns a [`ContextVerificationMetadata`](ref/Metadata#contextverificationmetadata) object containing the outcome of signature verification:

```typescript
{
  authenticity: {
    signed: true,           // A signature was present
    valid: true,            // The signature cryptographically verified
    jku: "https://myapp.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
    trusted: true           // allowListFunction(jku) returned true
  }
}
```

Applications can check these fields to make trust decisions:

## Encrypted Communications

While digital signatures prove *who* sent a message, they do not prevent the Desktop Agent or other intermediaries from reading it. To keep context data confidential, applications can encrypt it so that only the intended recipient can decrypt it.

### Why Symmetric Key Exchange?

Encrypting every message directly with the recipient's asymmetric public key is computationally expensive and impractical for a stream of context messages. The approach used here mirrors TLS: asymmetric cryptography is used once to securely exchange a *symmetric key*, then the much cheaper symmetric cipher (e.g. AES-GCM) encrypts the data stream itself.

A [JSON Web Encryption (JWE)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516) token is used to wrap (encrypt) the symmetric key using the recipient's public key, ensuring only the recipient — holding the corresponding private key — can unwrap it.

### Where Should the Symmetric Key Live?

Once the key has been unwrapped, the application must decide whether to hold it in the browser frontend or only in the trusted backend. This is a trade-off between latency and threat model:

**Frontend key (lower latency):** The unwrapping operation happens once on the backend (the only step requiring the private key), and the unwrapped symmetric key is returned to the frontend. All subsequent message decryption happens in the browser using the cheap symmetric cipher, with no per-message backend round-trip. This mirrors the TLS pattern most closely and is the right choice when the browser is considered a sufficiently trusted environment for a short-lived session key.

**Backend key (stricter boundary):** The symmetric key never leaves the backend. Every received message is forwarded from the frontend to the backend for decryption, and the plaintext is returned to the frontend. This adds a per-message WebSocket round-trip, which largely offsets the latency advantage of symmetric encryption. However, it is the correct choice when the threat model requires that decrypted plaintext *never* exists in browser memory — for example, when handling highly regulated data or when the browser environment itself is not considered trusted.

Both approaches use exactly the same key exchange protocol (`fdc3.security.symmetricKeyRequest` / `fdc3.security.symmetricKeyResponse`). The choice affects only what happens to the key after it is unwrapped.

### Private Channel Encryption

Applications communicating over a [`PrivateChannel`](ref/PrivateChannel) can negotiate encryption to ensure their communications remain confidential. This is particularly important when sharing sensitive data such as positions, pricing, or user information.

### Symmetric Key Exchange

Encryption uses a symmetric key (e.g. AES-GCM) created by the channel owner and distributed via JWE.

**Key owner (broadcaster):** Creates and holds the symmetric key. Encrypts context payloads with it and broadcasts them wrapped in [`fdc3.security.encryptedContext`](../context/ref/security/EncryptedContextWrapper). The `originalType` field of the wrapper preserves the original context type for routing, and `id.kid` identifies the symmetric key. The encrypted payload (all remaining fields of the original context) is stored as a JWE compact serialization in `encryptedPayload`. When a key request arrives, verifies the requestor's JWS (signature valid and `allowListFunction(jku)` returns true), reads `jku` from their JWS protected header, fetches their public key from that JWKS, wraps the symmetric key in a JWE using that public key (e.g. RSA-OAEP), signs the response with JWS, and broadcasts it.

**Key requestor (listener):** Listens for `fdc3.security.encryptedContext` by checking `type === 'fdc3.security.encryptedContext'` before dispatching to the appropriate handler. Broadcasts a signed key request (JWS) when it needs the symmetric key. When the response arrives, verifies the JWS, unwraps the JWE with their private key to obtain the symmetric key, then decrypts subsequent encrypted payloads. If an encrypted message arrives before the key, the requestor sends a key request.

Both the key request and response **MUST be signed** (JWS). The key owner uses the requestor's `jku` from the JWS header to target the JWE—only that requestor's private key can unwrap it.

#### Context Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`fdc3.security.symmetricKeyRequest`](../context/ref/security/SymmetricKeyRequest) | Request for the channel symmetric key (optional `id.kid`). MUST be signed. |
| [`fdc3.security.symmetricKeyResponse`](../context/ref/security/SymmetricKeyResponse) | Response containing `wrappedKey` (JWE) and `id.{kid,pki}`. MUST be signed. |
| [`fdc3.security.encryptedContext`](../context/ref/security/EncryptedContextWrapper) | Wrapper with `encryptedPayload` (JWE compact serialization); `originalType` and `id.kid` preserved for routing. |

:::tip Reference implementation samples
- [`backend-encrypted-channel-example.ts`](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/main/packages/fdc3-security/samples/backend-encrypted-channel-example.ts) — **backend key**: the symmetric key is held entirely on both apps' backends. Every message decryption incurs a backend round-trip. Use this pattern when decrypted plaintext must never exist in browser memory.
- [`frontend-encrypted-channel-example.ts`](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/main/packages/fdc3-security/samples/frontend-encrypted-channel-example.ts) — **frontend key**: the symmetric key is unwrapped once on the receiving app's backend, then returned to the frontend for low-latency per-message decryption. Use this pattern when the browser is a sufficiently trusted environment for a short-lived session key.

| [`encrypted-channel-receiver`](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/tree/main/toolbox/fdc3-example-apps/server-apps/encrypted-channel-receiver) | **Frontend key** — backend unwraps the symmetric key once via `exchangeData('unwrap-symmetric-key')`; frontend decrypts each message directly |
| [`security-demo-app1`](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/tree/main/toolbox/fdc3-example-apps/server-apps/security-demo-app1) | Receives encrypted `fdc3.valuation` snapshots over a private channel obtained from `demo.GetPrices` |
| [`security-demo-app2`](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/tree/main/toolbox/fdc3-example-apps/server-apps/security-demo-app2) | Broadcasts encrypted `fdc3.valuation` snapshots over the private channel using `EncryptedBroadcastSupport` |

## User Identity

In a multi-app FDC3 environment, applications often need to know who the user is—for personalization, access control, audit trails, or to share session state across tools. Instead of each app authenticating the user separately, an **identity provider app** — an FDC3 application with the ability to authenticate the current user and issue signed identity tokens (not to be confused with an OAuth 2.0 / OIDC identity provider; no redirect flows or token endpoints are involved) — can issue a portable, verifiable identity that any trusted app can consume. The identity provider app signs a JWT containing user claims; receiving apps verify the signature and trust the identity.

**Audience scoping** ensures each JWT is bound to a specific requesting application via the `aud` (audience) claim — a standard JWT field ([RFC 7519 §4.1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3)) that identifies the intended recipient of the token. By setting `aud` to the requesting application's URL, the token cannot be reused by a different application even if intercepted. This enables single sign-on (SSO) across FDC3 applications while keeping tokens narrowly scoped.

### The User Context Type

The [`fdc3.security.user`](../context/ref/security/User) context type carries a verified user identity. The `wrappedJwt` field contains a JWT that has been encrypted (wrapped as a JWE) using the *requesting application's public key*, so that only the requesting application — which holds the corresponding private key — can decrypt and read it. This prevents the token from being read by the Desktop Agent or any other application that may observe the intent result.

```typescript
{
  type: "fdc3.security.user",
  wrappedJwt: "<JWE-wrapped JWT — decrypt with your application's private key>"
}
```

### JWT Token Structure

The `wrappedJwt` field, once decrypted with the application's private key, contains a signed JSON Web Token with the following structure:

**Header:**
```json
{
  "alg": "EdDSA",
  "jku": "https://idp.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
  "kid": "key-1"
}
```

**Payload:**
```json
{
  "iss": "https://idp.example.com",
  "sub": "john.doe@example.com",
  "aud": "https://requesting-app.example.com",
  "exp": 1739750400,
  "iat": 1739746800,
  "jti": "unique-token-id-123"
}
```

| Claim | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `iss` | Issuer - the identity provider app that created the token |
| `sub` | Subject - the user's unique identifier |
| `aud` | Audience - the URL of the application this token was issued for |
| `exp` | Expiration time (Unix epoch seconds — see note below) |
| `iat` | Issued at time (Unix epoch seconds — see note below) |
| `jti` | JWT ID - unique identifier for this token (replay prevention) |

:::note
`exp` and `iat` use Unix epoch seconds (NumericDate as defined in [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)), rather than the ISO 8601 format used elsewhere in FDC3. This is mandated by the JWT specification.
:::

The token is scoped to a specific application (`aud`) to prevent token reuse if leaked.

### Requesting User Identity

1. The requester raises the [`GetUser`](../intents/ref/GetUser.md) intent with a signed [`fdc3.security.userRequest`](../context/ref/security/UserRequest) context. The context includes an `aud` field set to the requesting application's URL — the identity provider app embeds this in the JWT's `aud` claim so the requester can verify the token was issued specifically for it. The request MUST be signed to prevent forgery by third parties.

2. The identity provider app verifies the requester's signature on the request.

3. The identity provider app creates a JWT containing the claims described above, scoped to the requested audience.

4. The identity provider app wraps the JWT with the requester's public key (as a JWE) and returns the `fdc3.security.user` context as the intent result.

5. The requester decrypts the wrapped JWT with their private key and verifies the JWT signature using the identity provider app's public keys (from `{idpBaseUrl}/.well-known/jwks.json`). It also verifies expiry and MUST verify that the `jti` has not been used recently (i.e. within the expiry window).

    IdentityProviderApp->>Application: GetUser Intent Reply
    note left of Application: Unwrap JWT (private key)
    note left of Application: Verify JWT signature
    note left of Application: Authenticate user
```

### Token Security

- JWT tokens are scoped to specific audiences to prevent misuse if leaked
- Short expiration times reduce the window for token theft attacks
- Unique token identifiers (`jti`) MUST be used to prevent token replay attacks
- Tokens SHOULD be transmitted over encrypted channels when possible
