## What Is It?

[FDC3](https://fdc3.finos.org) is an open standard for applications on financial desktop to interoperate and exchange data with each other.  

- Users benefit from a more joined-up experience, which reduces the "friction" in getting common tasks done,
- By enabling applications to:
  - launch other apps (build a launcher),
  - respond to activity in other apps (context sharing),
  - request functionality from other apps (raising intents).

### What Are The Benefits?

#### 📇 Help Manage Information Overload

> Finance is an information-dense environment.  
> Typically, traders will use serveral different displays so that they can keep track of multiple information sources at once.
> FDC3 helps with this by sharing the "context" between multiple applications, so that they collectively track the topic the user is focused on.

#### 🏃‍♂️ Work Faster

> FDC3 standardizes a way to call actions between applications (called "intents").
> Applications can raise intents for other apps to resolve, extending each other's functionality.
> Instead of the user copy-and-pasting bits of data from one application to another, FDC3 makes sure the intents have the data they need to seamlessly transition activity between applications.

#### 🖥️  Platform Agnostic

> As an open standard, FDC3 can be implemented on any platform and in any language.
> All that is required is a "Desktop Agent" that implements the FDC3 standard, which is responsible for co-ordinating application interactions.  (For a list of open source and proprietary desktop agents, see "Platform providers" [here](https://fdc3.finos.org/community#type-platform-provider).)
> FDC3 is successfully running on Web and Native platforms in financial institutions around the world.

#### 🔌  End the Integration Nightmare

> By providing support for FDC3, vendors and financial organizations alike can avoid the bilateral or trilateral integration projects that plague desktop app roll-out, cause vendor lock-in and result in a slow pace of change on the Financial Services desktop.

#### 👐 Open Standards Promote Innovation

> FDC3 is developed collaboratively by a [consortium of industry participants](https://fdc3.finos.org/community#type-all) including banks, agent vendors, app developers and FinTech firms.  By design, FDC3 is open to extension.  We have an active community working on growing and improving the standard with new data and intents.

## How Does It Work?

FDC3 includes a standardized API for a Desktop agent, an OpenAPI App Directory, standard verbs to invoke actions between applications (called "intents"), standard formats for data passed between applications (called "context data") and a wire-protocol for Desktop Agents to communicate with each other (called "Desktop Agent Bridging").

Hence, the standard currently consists of five parts:

1. [API Part](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/api/spec)
2. [App Directory Part](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/app-directory/overview)
3. [Intents part](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/intents/spec)
4. [Context Data Part](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/context/spec)
5. [Agent Bridging Part](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/next/agent-bridging/spec) [`@experimental`](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/fdc3-compliance#experimental-features)

The specifications are informed by agreed [business use cases](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/use-cases/overview), and implemented and used by leading [financial industry participants](https://fdc3.finos.org/community#type-all).

### Building and Running The FDC3 Modules

From the root package, you can run `npm run build` to build all the modules, or `npm run test` to run all the tests.  `npm run dev` will start the `demo` and `fdc3-workbench` modules.

For installation and usage instructions, see: <https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/supported-platforms#usage>

### Releasing FDC3 to NPM (for maintainers)

This is a 4-step process:

1.  **Create a release branch**

  Do this locally.  Ensure the branch is named `release/v2.0` (or whatever the next version is).
  
  ```bash
  git checkout -b release/v2.0
  ```
  
2.  **Update the version numbers in the package.json files**

  It's important that all of the versions of the submodules stay on the same version, and that the references between them are consistent to that version.  To change the version number (say before or after a release) run the following:

  ```bash
  // first, update version number in package.json
  npm login
  npm version <new version from package.json> --workspaces // changes the version number in all submodule package.json files
  npm run syncpack                          // sycnhronizes version numbers
  npm up                                    // fixes node_module references
  npm run build                             // builds all the modules against the new version
  ```

3.  **Push the branch to publish the packages to npm**

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Updated to version vx.x" 
  git push origin release/v2.0
  ```
  
  This should trigger a GitHub action that will publish the packages to npm.

4.  **Create a PR for merging the release branch.**

  Once the packages are published, create a PR to merge the release branch into the main branch.  You will need other FDC3 maintainers to review and approve the PR.

5.  **Reset the `latest` NPM Version Tag If Releasing A Prerelease**

  If you're releasing beta/alpha code, be sure to replace the latest version in NPM like so:

  ```
  npm dist-tag add @finos/fdc3@2.1.1 latest
  ```

  You will need support from help@finos.org for this step.

### Releasing the FDC3 Website (for maintainers)

Please see instructions in the [website README](./website/README.md).

### Interact with the FDC3 community

#### GitHub

- FDC3 activity primarily happens in this [FDC3 GitHub repository](https://github.com/finos/fdc3). [Watch](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) the repository in order to be notified of new Pull Requests and issues.

#### Slack

- The fastest and more interactive way to connect and ask questions to the FDC3 community is to join the [#fdc3 channel on the FINOS slack](https://finos-lf.slack.com/messages/fdc3/).

#### Email

- If you'd like to receive official updates, and/or you don't have access to Slack, please send an email to [fdc3@finos.org](mailto:fdc3@finos.org). You can join the list by sending an email to [fdc3+subscribe@finos.org](mailto:fdc3+subscribe@finos.org).
- To contact the FDC3 maintainers, send an email to [fdc3-maintainers@finos.org](mailto:fdc3-maintainers@finos.org).

#### Meetings

- Finally, another great way to interact with the community, is to attend the monthly [FDC3 Standard Working Group Meeting](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/issues?q=label%3A%22Standard+WG+Meeting%22) and/or the quarterly [FDC3 General Meeting](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/issues?q=label%3A%22General+Meeting%22).
- Email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) to be added to the meeting invite directly, or find the meeting in the [FINOS Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=finos.org_fac8mo1rfc6ehscg0d80fi8jig%40group.calendar.google.com).

#### Need help?

- Email [fdc3@finos.org](mailto:fdc3@finos.org) if you need help getting started in the FDC3 Community.
- If you encounter technical difficulties accessing repositories, joining Slack, mailing lists or meetings, please email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org).

### Roadmap

Work on FDC3 is split into several [discussion groups](GOVERNANCE.md#1roles) and releases.  

- Discussion groups each have their own regular meetings in the [FINOS Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=finos.org_fac8mo1rfc6ehscg0d80fi8jig%40group.calendar.google.com).  

- Releases can be tracked on the [FDC3 Milestones](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/milestones) page.

### Contributing

Please see the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for details on how to contribute to FDC3.

_NOTE:_

- Issues that change the Standard usually need discussion. You can post comments directly on the issue or can ask for it to be added to a Standards Working Group meeting agenda by emailing [fdc3@finos.org](mailto:fdc3@finos.org), sending a message to the [#fdc3 channel on the FINOS slack](https://finos-lf.slack.com/messages/fdc3/) or tag the FDC3 maintainers (`@finos/fdc3-maintainers`) in your issue.
- Contributions merged into the main branch of the FDC3 repository will form part of the next pre-draft of the FDC3 Standard (as defined by the [FDC3 Governance document](./GOVERNANCE.md)), which must be approved by a Standard Working Group vote before it is accepted as a draft and subsequently released as the next version of the Standard.

### Why should you get involved in FDC3?

If you or your firm intends to make use of the FDC3 Standard (by implementing a Desktop Agent or App Directory, by adding support to apps to interoperate with others via FDC3, or even by using apps, Desktop Agents or App Directories written by others) then contributing to the governance, maintenance and onward development of the FDC3 Standard will help to protect and strengthen the ecosystem developing around FDC3. Doing so will also empower you to help guide the Standard in directions that are relevant to your use or that of your firm.

If you or your firm are new to contributing to open source projects, please see the variety of resources available from FINOS, (such as the [Open Source readiness project](https://www.finos.org/open-source-readiness)), Linux Foundation ([Participating in Open Source communities](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/tools/participating-in-open-source-communities/)) and others (e.g. [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/)).
