## What Is It?

[FDC3](https://fdc3.finos.org) is an open standard for applications on financial desktop to interoperate and exchange data with each other.  

- Users benefit from a more joined-up experience, which reduces the "friction" in getting common tasks done,
- By enabling applications to:
  - launch other apps (build a launcher),
  - respond to activity in other apps (context sharing),
  - request functionality from other apps (raising intents).

### What Are The Benefits?

#### 📇 Help Manage Information Overload

> Finance is an information-dense environment.  
> Typically, traders will use serveral different displays so that they can keep track of multiple information sources at once.
> FDC3 helps with this by sharing the "context" between multiple applications, so that they collectively track the topic the user is focused on.

#### 🏃‍♂️ Work Faster

> FDC3 standardizes a way to call actions between applications (called "intents").
> Applications can raise intents for other apps to resolve, extending each other's functionality.
> Instead of the user copy-and-pasting bits of data from one application to another, FDC3 makes sure the intents have the data they need to seamlessly transition activity between applications.

#### 🖥️  Platform Agnostic

> As an open standard, FDC3 can be implemented on any platform and in any language.
> All that is required is a "Desktop Agent" that implements the FDC3 standard, which is responsible for co-ordinating application interactions.  (For a list of open source and proprietary desktop agents, see "Platform providers" [here](https://fdc3.finos.org/community#type-platform-provider).)
> FDC3 is successfully running on Web and Native platforms in financial institutions around the world.

#### 🔌  End the Integration Nightmare

> By providing support for FDC3, vendors and financial organizations alike can avoid the bilateral or trilateral integration projects that plague desktop app roll-out, cause vendor lock-in and result in a slow pace of change on the Financial Services desktop.

#### 👐 Open Standards Promote Innovation

> FDC3 is developed collaboratively by a [consortium of industry participants](https://fdc3.finos.org/community#type-all) including banks, agent vendors, app developers and FinTech firms.  By design, FDC3 is open to extension.  We have an active community working on growing and improving the standard with new data and intents.

## How Does It Work?

FDC3 includes a standardized API for a Desktop agent, an OpenAPI App Directory, standard verbs to invoke actions between applications (called "intents"), standard formats for data passed between applications (called "context data") and a wire-protocol for Desktop Agents to communicate with each other (called "Desktop Agent Bridging").

Hence, the standard currently consists of five parts:

1. [API Part](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/api/spec)
2. [App Directory Part](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/app-directory/overview)
3. [Intents part](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/intents/spec)
4. [Context Data Part](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/context/spec)
5. [Agent Bridging Part](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/next/agent-bridging/spec) [`@experimental`](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/fdc3-compliance#experimental-features)

The specifications are informed by agreed [business use cases](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/use-cases/overview), and implemented and used by leading [financial industry participants](https://fdc3.finos.org/community#type-all).

### More Resources

- See <https://fdc3.finos.org> for more information, including on [Compliance](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/fdc3-compliance) and the [FDC3 charter](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/fdc3-charter), as well as a comprehensive [API Reference](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/api/ref/DesktopAgent).
- You can also take the free [FDC3 Training](https://www.edx.org/course/fdc3-interoperability-for-the-financial-desktop) for an introduction to FDC3's core concepts and usage.
- The [FDC3 Community Page Training Tab](https://fdc3.finos.org/community#type-examples-and-training) also contains a selection of online resources to browse.
- FINOS' open source Desktop Agent, [FDC3 Sail](https://github.com/finos/FDC3-Sail) project written with Node / Electron.

## Supported Platforms

- As an open standard, FDC3 can be implemented on any platform and in any language.
- All that is required is a "desktop agent" that supports the FDC3 standard, which is responsible for coordinating application interactions.
- Get started using FDC3 on the web with TypeScript by reading the [supported platforms](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/supported-platforms) page.

### FDC3 npm module

The FDC3 npm package does NOT provide a Desktop Agent implementation. Rather, it can by used by web applications to target operations from the API Specification in a consistent way. Each FDC3-compliant desktop agent that the application runs in, can then provide an implementation of the FDC3 API operations.

For installation and usage instructions, see: <https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/supported-platforms#usage>

### Roadmap

Work on FDC3 is split into several [discussion groups](GOVERNANCE.md#1roles) and releases.  

- Discussion groups each have their own regular meetings in the [FINOS Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=finos.org_fac8mo1rfc6ehscg0d80fi8jig%40group.calendar.google.com).  

- Releases can be tracked on the [FDC3 Milestones](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/milestones) page.

### Contributing

Please see the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for details on how to contribute to FDC3.

_NOTE:_

- Issues that change the Standard usually need discussion. You can post comments directly on the issue or can ask for it to be added to a Standards Working Group meeting agenda by emailing [fdc3@finos.org](mailto:fdc3@finos.org), sending a message to the [#fdc3 channel on the FINOS slack](https://finos-lf.slack.com/messages/fdc3/) or tag the FDC3 maintainers (`@finos/fdc3-maintainers`) in your issue.
- Contributions merged into the main branch of the FDC3 repository will form part of the next pre-draft of the FDC3 Standard (as defined by the [FDC3 Governance document](./GOVERNANCE.md)), which must be approved by a Standard Working Group vote before it is accepted as a draft and subsequently released as the next version of the Standard.

### Why should you get involved in FDC3?

If you or your firm intends to make use of the FDC3 Standard (by implementing a Desktop Agent or App Directory, by adding support to apps to interoperate with others via FDC3, or even by using apps, Desktop Agents or App Directories written by others) then contributing to the governance, maintenance and onward development of the FDC3 Standard will help to protect and strengthen the ecosystem developing around FDC3. Doing so will also empower you to help guide the Standard in directions that are relevant to your use or that of your firm.

If you or your firm are new to contributing to open source projects, please see the variety of resources available from FINOS, (such as the [Open Source readiness project](https://www.finos.org/open-source-readiness)), Linux Foundation ([Participating in Open Source communities](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/tools/participating-in-open-source-communities/)) and others (e.g. [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/)).
