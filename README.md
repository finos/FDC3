# FDC3

The mission of the Financial Desktop Connectivity and Collaboration Consortium (FDC3) is to develop specific protocols and taxonomies to advance the ability of desktop applications in financial workflows to interoperate in a plug-and-play fashion and without prior, bi-lateral agreements.

## About this Repository
FDC3 is a standard.  This repository houses the documentation and specifications for the ratified FDC3 standards. To join Working Groups meetings and Mailing lists where the standard is built, please check the [FDC3 space in the FINOS Wiki](http://wiki.finos.org/fdc3).

## Contributing

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/FDC3/FDC3/fork>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

The team will review the PR and decide about merging. Note that you will require a contributor agreement (individual or corporate) before your code can be merge, so please review [FINOS Contribution requirements](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Roadmap
With Productization on track to land at end of Q1, the expectation is that Q2 will be focused on implementations and feedback from those implementations driving further standards.  
### Target Items for Q2
#### API
* Expand the broadcast API or introduce a new channels API to support the context setting use case. 
* Publish npm package with FDC3 API definitions.

#### App Directory
* Search capabilities, surfacing other content
* Manifest format detail (describing the content)
* Eventing

#### Context Data
* Pivot to JSON schema for representing type definitions. We have found that TypeScript is too implementation-specific and too restrictive in practice.
* Use https://quicktype.io/ to generate type definitions from JSON schema for multi-language support.
* Formalise current example types into official FDC3 types for contact, organisation, instrument etc in conjunction with/based on the Financial Objects program work.

#### Intents
* Add detailed documentation to each intent - linking to use cases
* Align closer with Context Data WG
* Evaluate real use cases, given that we have input from early adapters
* Extend with new intents, based on above + accepted use cases

#### Use Cases
* Continue to process new and existing FDC3 Use Cases
* Assess extending the use cases working group to additional FINOS programs

### Backlog Beyond Q2
* Define the next set of FDC3 Context Data types in conjunction with/based on Financial Objects working group work.
* Work with Financial Objects and other FINOS programs to reach consensus on how to make standardized taxonomies available for consumption, both for viewing/editing and programmatically e.g. for validation. 
* Create comprehensive examples of use cases that show how to use the various FDC3 standards together to enable interoperability.
* App Directory Identity and authentication
