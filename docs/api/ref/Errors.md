title: Errors

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

FDC3 API operations may sometimes result in an error that is returned to the caller. Errors MUST be returned by rejecting the promise returned by the API with a JavaScript `Error` object (or equivalent for the language of the implementation). The `Error` Object's message should be chosen from the appropriate Error enumeration below.

## `AgentError`

Contains constants representing the errors that can be encountered when calling the [`getAgent`](getAgent) function to establish connectivity to a Desktop Agent. Primarily used with web applications, but may also be used in other language implementations.

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript/JavaScript">

```ts
enum AgentError { 
    /** Returned if no Desktop Agent was found by any means available or 
     * if the Agent previously connected to is not contactable on a  
     * subsequent connection attempt.*/
    AgentNotFound = "AgentNotFound",

    /** Returned if validation of the app identity by the Desktop Agent 
     * failed or the app is not being allowed to connect to the Desktop Agent 
     * for another reason. */ 
    AccessDenied = "AccessDenied",

    /** Returned if an error or exception occurs while trying to set  
     * up communication with a Desktop Agent. */ 
    ErrorOnConnect = "ErrorOnConnect",

    /** Returned if the failover function is not a function, or it did not
     * resolve to one of the allowed types.*/ 
    InvalidFailover = "InvalidFailover",
} 
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## `ChannelError`

Contains constants representing the errors that can be encountered when calling channels using the [`joinUserChannel`](DesktopAgent#joinuserchannel) or [`getOrCreateChannel`](DesktopAgent#getorcreatechannel) methods, or the [`getCurrentContext`](Channel#getcurrentcontext), [`broadcast`](Channel#broadcast) or [`addContextListener`](Channel#addcontextlistener) methods on the `Channel` object.

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript/JavaScript">

```ts
enum ChannelError {
  /** Returned if the specified channel is not found when attempting to join a
   *  channel via the `joinUserChannel` function of the DesktopAgent (`fdc3`).
   */
  NoChannelFound = "NoChannelFound",

  /** SHOULD be returned when a request to join a user channel or to a retrieve
   *  a Channel object via the `joinUserChannel` or `getOrCreateChannel` methods
   *  of the DesktopAgent (`fdc3`) object is denied. 
   */
  AccessDenied = "AccessDenied",
  
  /** SHOULD be returned when a channel cannot be created or retrieved via the
   *  `getOrCreateChannel` method of the DesktopAgent (`fdc3`).
   */
  CreationFailed = "CreationFailed",

  /** Returned if a call to the `broadcast` functions is made with an invalid
   *  context argument. Contexts should be Objects with at least a `type` field
   *  that has a `string` value.

Contains constants representing the errors that can be encountered when queries are forwarded to a Desktop Agent Bridge, but one or more remote Desktop Agents connected to it disconnects, times-out or a malformed message is encountered while a particular request is in flight. These errors may be returned via the FDC3 API when a Desktop Agent is (or was) connected to a Desktop Agent Bridge.
