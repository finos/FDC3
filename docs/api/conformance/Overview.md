# FDC3 Conformance Tests

This section contains test definitions that are used to test for conformance of a Desktop Agent API implementation with FDC3.

:::warning

Additions to the conformance tests for functionality introduced in FDC3 2.2 are still to be defined.

Further, as FDC3 2.1 does not introduce changes to the Desktop Agent API, the conformance test set for FDC3 2.0 remains current at this time. Please see the [FDC3 2.1 Changelog entry](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#fdc3-standard-21---2023-09-13) for more details.

:::

You can find the implementation of these tests in the [FDC3 Conformance Framework](https://github.com/finos/FDC3-conformance-framework) project.

There are currently 6 sections to the tests.  

- [Basic Tests](Basic-Tests.md)
- [Open Tests](Open-Tests.md)
- [User Channel Tests](User-Channel-Tests.md)
- [App Channel Tests](App-Channel-Tests.md)
- [Metadata Tests](Metadata-Tests.md)
- [Intents Tests](Intents-Tests.md)
