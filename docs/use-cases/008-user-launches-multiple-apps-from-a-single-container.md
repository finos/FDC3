## Workflow 1
From a button next to a holding in the portfolio management system a user launches four applications from the research and analytics platform into the open workspace
The applications open within a single container and all show information on the holding

## Workflow 2
From a button next to a holding in the portfolio management system a user launches four applications from the research and analytics platform into the open workspace
The applications open within a single container and all show information on the holding
Selecting a different holding in the portfolio management system updates the launched layout automatically (it is linked when it is launched)

## Workflow 3
The user wants to open 4 apps from the research and analytics platform to find more information on a particular holding
A menu shows all the available apps that accept the holding in context that can be launched into the workspace
The user selects four and has the option to open as floating apps or within a single container
The user decides to launch them in a single container
An Eikon layout opens with the four apps that the user has selected showing information on the current holding
