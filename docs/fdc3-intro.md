title: Welcome to FDC3
sidebar_label: Introduction

FDC3 aims to provide an **open standard for interoperability** between applications on the financial desktop.

This includes standardized verbs to invoke actions between applications (called "intents"), a standardized data format, a REST-based app directory standard, and standardized API operations.

## Motivation

FDC3 codifies standard patterns that application developers have been using for cross-application workflows between web and native applications
in the financial industry.

According to the [FDC3 Charter](fdc3-charter):
> The mission of FDC3 is to develop specific protocols and taxonomies to advance the ability of desktop applications in financial workflows to interoperate in a plug-and-play fashion, without prior bi-lateral agreements.

For more information, see [Why FDC3](why-fdc3).
## Specifications

The standard currently consists of four complementary specifications:

- [API](api/spec)
- [Intents](intents/spec)
- [Context Data](context/spec)
- [App Directory](app-directory/spec)

## Use Cases

From its inception, the standards have been informed by real-world [business use cases](use-cases/overview), which you can view on this website,
and form an important part of FDC3.
## Who is using FDC3?

FDC3 was launched in October 2017 by [OpenFin](http://www.openfin.co) in collaboration with [major industry participants](/users). It includes representatives from over 40 major banks, buy-side firms, consultancies and financial services platforms.

## How is FDC3 governed?

FDC3 is hosted within, and governed by the policies of, the [Fintech Open Source Foundation](http://finos.org/) (FINOS). FINOS is an independent nonprofit organization focused on promoting open innovation within financial services.

FDC3 uses the Apache 2.0 open source license for all deliverables.
