# Nothing

A type that explicitly represents a lack of context.

Notes:

- Intended to be used in situations where no context is desired.
- For example:
  - Raising an intent without context (e.g. opening a blank order form, or chat interface without a contact selected).
  - Resetting context on a channel (e.g. when context is used to set a filter in other applications a null context might release the filter).
- An explicit representation of a Null or empty context allows apps to declare support for a lack of context, for example in their intent metadata in an app directory.
