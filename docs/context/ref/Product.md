# Product

[@experimental](/docs/fdc3-compliance#experimental-features) context type representing a tradable product. To be used with OMS and EMS systems.

This type is currently only loosely defined as an extensible context object, with an optional instrument field.

The Product schema does not explicitly include identifiers in the id section, as there is not a common standard for such identifiers. Applications can, however, populate this part of the contract with custom identifiers if so desired.
