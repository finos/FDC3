# Trade

[@experimental](/docs/fdc3-compliance#experimental-features) context type representing a trade. To be used with execution systems.

This type currently only defines a required `id` field, which should provide a reference to the trade in one or more systems, an optional human readable `name` field to be used to summarize the trade and a required `product` field that may be used to provide additional detail about the trade, which is currently typed as a unspecified Context type, but `product` is expected to be standardized in future.

 The Trade schema does not explicitly include identifiers in the id section, as there is not a common standard for such identifiers. Applications can, however, populate this part of the contract with custom identifiers if so desired.
