# Position

A financial position made up of an instrument and a holding in that instrument. This type is a good example of how new context types can be composed from existing types.

In this case, the instrument and the holding amount for that instrument are required values.

The [Position](Position) type goes hand-in-hand with the [Portfolio](Portfolio) type, which represents multiple holdings in a combination of instruments.

The position schema does not explicitly include identifiers in the `id` section, as there is not a common standard for such identifiers. Applications can, however, populate this part of the contract with custom identifiers if so desired.
